# Naive Bayes Implementation

This repo manually implements the Naive Bayes algorithm with a Gaussian distribution.

This is a project to design a bare-bones machine learning algorithm from scratch
for my own personal edification. I wrote about how I did this, and Naive Bayes
in general, on my Medium blog: see [blog post 1](https://medium.com/@ajenkneary/a-from-scratch-implementation-of-naive-bayes-pt-1-2d8b28734d72) and [blog post 2](https://medium.com/@ajenkneary/a-from-scratch-implementation-of-naive-bayes-pt-1-2d8b28734d72) for details on the implementation.
